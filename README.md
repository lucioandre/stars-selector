# Star-Rating Component

This small project demonstrates a component to display a Rating UI based on Stars.

The component is named RatingView and is a UIView subclass.
It supports IBDesignable and IBInspectable in order to give a nice experience when using with storyboards.
The RatingView can be created using Storyboards or programmatically.
The stars colors can be set by changing the tint color for the view.
It supports a delegate named RatingViewDelegate in order to inform changes in the rating value.

The demo includes a label that will display the current selection.
